# m4thayus's macOS dotfiles
Contains all the relavent configuration files for my (macOS-based) dev environment. A short list of configured apps and tools follows:

- Terminal Emulator: kitty
- Text Editor: neovim (though configs are written to .vimrc, with a symlink to init.vim, for compatibility with standard vim)
- Ruby Versioning: rbenv
- Node Versioning: nodenv
- Linting: eslint (js) and rubocop (rb)
- Source Control: git (obviously)
- QoL: coc, fzf, and ripgrep
- aws (just an auth script to keep up with mfa)
