# m4thayus's macOS dotfiles
Contains all the relavent configuration files for my (macOS-based) dev environment. A short list of configured apps and tools follows:

- Terminal Emulator: kitty or alacritty with tmux as a multiplexer
- Text Editor: neovim (though configs are written to .vimrc, with a symlink to init.vim, for compatibility with standard vim)
- Ruby Versioning: rbenv
- Node Versioning: nodenv
- Local Environment Configuration: direnv
- Linting: eslint, coffeelint, and rubocop
- QoL: coc, fzf, and ripgrep
- aws (just an auth script to keep up with mfa)
